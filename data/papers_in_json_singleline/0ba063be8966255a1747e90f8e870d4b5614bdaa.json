Note that this group contains the susceptible, latent, (that is, when the individual has been infected, but does not yet show symptoms or is not still capable of infecting) and asymptomatic infectious, all of them of age less than or equal to . Immediately a member of this group is detected as infected, it is quarantined. In all that follows, governments are supposed to be in a position to exercise this measure.
