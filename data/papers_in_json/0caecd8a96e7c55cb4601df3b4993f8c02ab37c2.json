The hemagglutinin (lectin) of the influenza virus, responsible for its attachment to cells, was purified, crystallized, and studied in detail, culminating in the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of its complex with N-acetylneuraminic-acid-containing oligosaccharides at the atomic level . The subunit of the lectin is composed of two polypeptides, HA1 and HA2 (with molecular masses of 36 and 26kDa, respectively), covalently linked by a single disulfide bond, and it associates non-covalently to form trimers that are located on the surface of the viral membrane [27] . It is a glycoprotein, with six N-linked oligosaccharide chains attached to HA1 and one to HA2. Except for one oligomannose unit, all are complex, bi-or triantennary structures, with three of them containing sulfated galactose [29] . The carbohydrate binding site is located in a pocket of the HA1 polypeptide chain, in a domain of the lectin protruding from the membrane, and is composed of amino acids that are largely conserved in the numerous strains of the virus [27] . Other conserved residues are found behind the pocket and seem to stabilize the architecture of the site without interacting with the carbohydrate. Over 100 strains of influenza virus, mostly of the A-and B-types, were examined for their ability to bind to enzymatically modified erythrocytes carrying terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid attached to galactose either by an a2-3 or a2-6 linkage [ 12,261. Differences in their specificity with respect to this linkage were correlated with the species origin of the virus. Thus, human isolates preferentially agglutinated resialylated erythrocytes containing the NeuAc(a24)Gal sequence, while the avian and equine isolates exhibited preference for NeuAc(a2-3)Gal. Strains of influenza C virus (as well as coronaviruses) do not bind N-acetylneuraminic acid at all, but only recognize its derivative, 9-0-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid; the 9-0-acetyl group is critical for mediating cellular attachment [30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2020, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NeuAc(a2-3)Gal(fi1-3)GalNAc"}, {"text": "Comparison of the primary sequences of hemagglutinins of the human virus with those of mutants showing decreased affinity for NeuAc(a2-6)Gal and markedly increased affinity for NeuAc(a2-3)Gal, revealed that they differ in a single amino acid substitution, Leu226 in the parental strains being replaced by glutamine in the mutants. Similar studies with avian isolates and their variants showing the reverse change in specificity (from a2-3 to a 2 4 linked N-acetylneuraminic acid), again revealed a substitution only at position 226 -from glutamine to leucine. This illustrates that a single amino acid substitution can alter the sugar specificity of a lectin. Although residue 226 is located in the carbohydrate binding site of the hemagglutinin, it is not in direct contact with the bound sugar, as shown by crystallographic studies of wild-type influenza virus hemagglutinin complexed with NeuAc(a2-6)Gal(fi14)Glc [sialyl(a24)lactose] and of a mutant hemagglutinin complexed with NeuAc(a2-3)Gal(fil-4)Glc [sialyl(a2-3)lactose].

It also permitted to predict potential hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts of sialic acid atoms with amino acids in the binding site based on their proximity to each other. The validity of these predictions was tested by evaluating the affinity for the hemagglutinin of a series of synthetic analogs of N-acetylneuraminic acid with modified functional groups, by determining: (i) the ability of the analogs to inhibit viral attachment to cells [3 11 and (ii) the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of these analogs to the hemagglutinin [32] . It was thus confirmed that the two carboxylate oxygens of N-acetylneuraminic acid receive hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl group of Szr-136 and from the main chain amide group at Asn-137, respectively, and that both bonds are necessary for binding. These studies also provided additional evidence on the critical importance of the hydrophobic contact between the acetamido group at C-5 of N-acetylneuraminic acid with the indole ring of Trp-153.

Chaperons are also required for the assembly of other types of fimbriae, as well as of non-fimbrial lectins [43-451.

Thus, the combining sites of type 1 fimbriae of E. coli and K. pneumoniae correspond to the size of a trisaccharide and are in the form of a depression or pocket on the surface of the lectin [49] . In the case of the E. coli lectin, there are probably three adjacent subsites, each of which accommodates a monosaccharide residue.

Since the FimH subunits of the two organisms exhibit 88% homology, the possibility has been considered that the differences in specificity are due to differences in the presentation of the combining sites of these subunits in the fimbriae. To test this hypothesis, two types of hybrid fimbriae were genetically generated: in one of these the E. coli FimH was presented on a filament of K. pneumoniae structural subunits (EcFimH-KpFimA); in the other K. pneumoniae FimH was presented on a shaft of E. coli FimA (KpFimH-EcFimA) [50] . It was found that the specificity of the EcFimH-KpFimA hybrid with respect to aromatic a-mannosides was similar to that of native K. pneumoniae lectin, whereas that of KpFimH-EcFimA was like that of the E. coli lectin. These results indicate that the shaft on which FimH is presented plays a role in modulating the specificity of type 1 fimbriae lectins, probably by imposing conformational constraints on the carbohydrate binding subunit. The interspecies heterogeneity of the FimA subunit of enterobacteria thus ensures significant diversity in their sugar specificity and as a result, in the function of their lectins, as reflected by their ability to mediate adhesion to a particular type of animal cell. The notion that the fimbrial filament can influence the specificity of the carbohydrate binding moiety is novel and contrasts with the P fimbriae system, in which PapG appears to be the sole determinant of binding specificity. Recently a form of type 1 fimbriae has been described which, in addition to binding carbohydrates, interacts also with non-glycosylated regions of proteins in a mannoseinhibitable manner [51] . It is not clear whether this interaction occurs via the carbohydrate binding site proper and how it is inhibited by mannose. The difference between the two functional forms of the fimbriae may be due to subtle variations in FimH or to quantitative or qualitative differences in the assembly of one or more of the subunits.
